## Azure Services Used in this Project

1. **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes container orchestration service in Microsoft Azure for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.

2. **Azure Load Balancer**: It is a network service that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple virtual machines to ensure high availability, scalability, and reliability for applications hosted in Azure.

3. **Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS)**: It is a service that allows you to deploy and manage a group of identical virtual machines. It automatically increases or decreases the number of VM instances in response to changes in demand, helping to ensure high availability, load distribution, and efficient resource utilization for your applications.
